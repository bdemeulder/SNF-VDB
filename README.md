# SNF-Vanderbilt UMC
SNF analysis with Minoo Bagheri, Vanderbilt University Medical Centre, Centre for Precicion Medicine

This repository will detail how to perform a SNF analysis, choose the correct number of clusters, characterise the clusters and produce figures.
This analysis is tested using data subsets included in the repository. Data formatting is crucial for the analysis to work and should be replicated exactly.
